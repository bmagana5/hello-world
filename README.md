Refresher for using Git

Hello, my name is @#$@#. I am an alien; i hail from a distant land from a very distant planet light-years away from this planet called Earth. I don't have much to say other than: "Humans, why do you all lick your fingers when you eat? That seems so strange!" I suppose, though, it is your planet so you ought to do what you deem most fitting to your specie.
